```

## Base URL

```

## Making Your First Payment Request

```

### Sample Request

```json
{

  "currency": "USD",
  "recipient_id": "user_123",

}
```

### Sample cURL

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/d1/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "amount": 4300, "currency": "USD", "recipient_id": "user_123" }'
```
